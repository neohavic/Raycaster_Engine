# Raycaster\_Engine

Raycaster Engine in Python - VIBES ED.

Another Vibe Coding experiment, I.E. what can I whip up from my youth using AI, and how long will it take me?

The answer this time, at least to get a basic flat-shaded maze going with a mini-map and full WASD and mouse control

was about 1-1.5hrs, max. Don't know what I'm going to do with this, but it'll be cool to have in my back pocket.
